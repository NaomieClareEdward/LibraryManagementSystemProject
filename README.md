# Library Management System Project
This project was given in my programming class (december 2023) with the goal to explore the concept of Object Oriented Programming using C#, XAML/WPF.

## Project Description & Instructions

### Objective
The objective of this project is to build a simple C# WPF application. Utilize the OOP knowledge learnt in class to build better software. In addition, the application should maintain state by saving and loading data from and to text-based files (user should not start over every single time the app starts).  

### Description
Created a library management system that allows management of books and members

**log in as employee**
- User can search for books and see informations about them like the author, page number and status (borrowed or available).
- User can delete books from the library or add a book to the library.
- User can search members by username and see their name, password, and a list of borrowed books.
- User can delete or add a member.
- User can add a new employee.

**log in as member**

- Build a WPF GUI that will allow users to fulfill the requirements. You will need to create at least 2 windows to achieve the requirements. Data can be transferred between different windows using the class constructor as shown in class demo. 
- Organize your code by creating additional  classes with class members: data fields, properties, methods, setters and getters you think are required. Maintain OOP concepts as you design your classes.
